### Hi there, Kanz profile here 👋
Hope you doing well :D

- 👀 My name is similar to Kanz, maybe a bit different, but you can even call me like that in real life 😄
- 🎉 I'm part of the team responsible for @EnigmaticaModpacks (Aka: Contributor that does some stuff ^^) and I'm proud of this!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on few projects at once 😋 Just check my popular respositories / Projects page!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, you guessed it, Java! (And some other stuff as well, but that's less important)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first project in Java was created by just looking at one projects code, without even learning basics of Java ^^
- 📫 How to reach me: @Kanzaji#0407 on Discord
