## Hi there, Kanz profile here ðŸ‘‹

Hope you doing well :D Thanks for checking out my profile!

Here is some info about me:
---
- ðŸ‘€ My real name is similar to Kanz, maybe a bit different, but no one says you can't call me Kanz in real life as well ðŸ˜„
- ðŸŽ‰ I'm part of the awesome [@EnigmaticaModpacks](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks) team (Aka: Contributor that does some stuff) and I'm proud of this!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on few projects at once ðŸ˜‹ Just check my popular respositories / Projects page for details!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning pretty much everything, but I'm focusing on Java! Also learning JS / TS / Lua / C# / CPP / HTML Stuff and everything else I need to do my crazy projects. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: My [first project in Java](https://github.com/Kanzaji/Cat-Downloader-Legacy) was created by just looking at one projects code, without even learning basics of Java from tutorials!
