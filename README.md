### Hi there, Kanz profile here ðŸ‘‹
Hope you doing well :D

- ðŸ‘€ My real name is similar to Kanz, maybe a bit different, but you can call me Kanz in real life as well ðŸ˜„
- ðŸŽ‰ I'm part of the [@EnigmaticaModpacks](https://github.com/EnigmaticaModpacks) team (Aka: Contributor that does some stuff ^^) and I'm proud of this!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on few projects at once ðŸ˜‹ Just check my popular respositories / Projects page!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning, you guessed it, Java! (And some other stuff as well, but that's less important)
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first project in Java was created by just looking at one projects code, without even learning basics of Java ^^
